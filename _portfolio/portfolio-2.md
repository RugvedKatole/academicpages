Autonomously overtaking a lead vehicle on a two-way unseparated road can be a challenging problem for self-driving cars, especially when there is a possibility of an incoming vehicle in the adjacent lane. This problem requires a delicate balance between safety and efficiency in the autonomous overtaking process.

The motivation behind researching autonomous overtaking in such situations is to improve traffic flow, reduce travel times, and increase safety on the roads. According to the World Health Organization, road traffic accidents cause 1.35 million deaths globally each year, and over 90% of these accidents are caused by human error. Autonomous overtaking can reduce the likelihood of accidents caused by driver error, thus improving road safety.

Moreover, autonomous overtaking can enhance traffic flow and reduce travel times, especially on two-way unseparated roads with heavy traffic. This is particularly important in urban areas, where traffic congestion is a major problem, and reducing travel times can lead to significant economic and environmental benefits.

In summary, the problem of autonomously overtaking a lead vehicle on a two-way unseparated road where there is a possibility of an incoming vehicle in the adjacent lane is a complex but important challenge in the field of autonomous driving. Solving this problem can lead to significant improvements in road safety, traffic flow, and travel times, thus benefiting both society and the environment
