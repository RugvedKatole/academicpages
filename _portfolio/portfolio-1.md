title: "Autonomous Intersection Management"
excerpt: "In this project, our goal is to develop and implement an algorithm that enables autonomous vehicles to navigate intersections safely and efficiently without relying on traditional traffic signals. To achieve this, we will work on developing communication systems between vehicles and infrastructure, predicting the movements of vehicles, and adjusting their paths to prevent collisions and congestion. The ultimate aim is to enhance traffic flow, reduce fuel consumption and emissions, and enhance safety at intersections. 1<br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"

Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) is an innovative concept in transportation engineering that aims to improve traffic flow and safety at intersections by using autonomous vehicles and communication technologies. According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) in India, there were 150,785 road traffic fatalities in 2019, with an average of 413 deaths per day. This highlights the urgent need to improve road safety, especially at intersections.

The motivation behind researching AIM is to revolutionize the way we manage traffic at intersections and reduce the number of accidents and fatalities. AIM has the potential to reduce traffic congestion, travel times, fuel consumption, and emissions, and increase safety. By leveraging the latest advancements in autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, and communication technologies, we can develop a smarter and more efficient transportation system.

Moreover, the increasing popularity of autonomous vehicles and their potential to disrupt traditional transportation systems has led to a growing interest in AIM. According to MORTH, the number of registered motor vehicles in India increased by 5.03% from 2018 to 2019, reaching a total of 253.9 million vehicles. By developing and implementing AIM, we can better prepare for the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, which are expected to transform the way we travel and commute.

Overall, researching AIM is crucial for developing a more sustainable, efficient, and safe transportation system that meets the needs of our modern society and reduces the alarming number of road traffic fatalities in India.
