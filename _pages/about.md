Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Rugved, and I'm a Research Assistant at IIT Bombay, where I work on motion planning for self-driving cars under the guidance of [Prof. Arpita Sinha](https://sites.google.com/iitb.ac.in/arpitasinha/home?authuser=0). With one year of independent research experience at ARMS lab, I'm deeply passionate about the field of robotics and am actively seeking a Ph.D. position in Field Robotics, Bio-inspired Robotics and Multi-agent systems.

Throughout my academic journey, I've pursued my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from BITS Pilani and developed my Bachelor's thesis on prioritized patrolling of a structured environment at ARMS lab, IIT Bombay. I've been fortunate to have gained valuable experience in the field of robotics and have had the opportunity to work on several exciting [projects](https://rugvedkatole.github.io/portfolio/).

What drives me is the potential for robotics to revolutionize the world we live in, and I'm excited to be a part of that change. I've [publication](ugvedkatole.github.io/publications/) under progress and would continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the field of robotics. If you're interested in collaborating, discussing job opportunities, or just chatting about the exciting world of robotics, please don't hesitate to reach out! Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you
