**Abstract**

A capacitive pressure sensor measures the change in pressure through a calibrated circuit dueto displacement of the membrane. Capacitive pressure sensor involves two coupled physics, namely Electrostatics and Solid mechanics. COMSOL Multiphysics was used to simulate the sensor behavior under various conditions. A negative pressure wave, modeled in MATLAB, was imported as an input load to study the change in impedance and its sensitivity to different parameters. The parameters chosen for sensitivity analysis were (a) the material of the capacitor membrane and (b) the gas-filled in the cavity. Simulation study showed that the maximum displacement occurred at the center of the sensor membrane and reduced radially outwards; also a change in the capacitance due to the change in membrane material is also observed. While the same deflection and capacitance was observed when the cavity was filled with air and noble gases, there was improved total capacitance when the cavity was filled with Nitrogen. We conclude that a change in the dielectric material of the cavity and membrane material has a positive effect on the sensitivity of the sensor.
