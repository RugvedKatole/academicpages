**Abstract**

In this paper, we propose deterministic and stochastic algorithms to solve the problem of priority patrolling. The walks between the priority nodes are stored offline, and a patrolling strategy is assigned online through a reward mechanism. The number of walks grows exponentially with graph nodes. To cater the memory requirements of an agent, we present a novel walk-generation methodology with an adjustable parameter $D$ (called Depth). The depth parameter $D$ value depends on the memory available with the agent. The generated walk are assigned using a combination of deterministic and stochastic approaches. The effects of deterministic and stochastic approaches on reward mechanisms and depths are discussed.
